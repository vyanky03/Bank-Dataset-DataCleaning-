# Bank-Dataset DataCleaning
Done EDA and data visualization using jupyter.
I have used a bank dataset which contains data about their customers. 
Information like salary of customer, balance, loan/home loans, if any then dues of it, etc.
In first part, i have done cleaning of dataset, it contained few missing values in data set, few columns had object as datatype. 
The starting two rows were skipped while importing data into python.
Dropped columns which were not relevent for my analysis, handled outliers and standerdized the values 
Next, I have performed univariate and bivariate analysis
